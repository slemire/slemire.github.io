Delivery is a quick and fun easy box where we have to create a MatterMost account and validate it by using automatic email accounts created by the OsTicket application.

## Website

The Delivery website is pretty basic, there's a link to a vhost called helpdesk.delivery.htb and a contact us section. We'll add this entry to our local host before proceeding further.

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-delivery/website1.png)

The contact us section tells us we need an @delivery.htb email address and tells us port 8065 is a MatterMost server. MatterMost is a Slack-like collaboration platform that can be self-hosted.

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-delivery/website2.png)

Browsing to port 8065 we get the MatterMost login page but we don't have credentials yet

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-delivery/mm1.png)

## Helpdesk

The Helpdesk page uses the OsTicket web application. It allows users to create and view the status of ticket.

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-delivery/helpdesk3.png)

We can still open new tickets even if we only have a guest user.

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-delivery/helpdesk1.png)

After a ticket has been created, the system generates a random @delivery.htb email account with the ticket ID.

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-delivery/helpdesk2.png)

Now that we have an email account we can create a MatterMost account.

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-delivery/mm2.png)

A confirmation email is then sent to our ticket status inbox.

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-delivery/mm3.png)

We use the check ticket function on the OsTicket application and submit the original email address we used when creating the ticket and the ticket ID.

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-delivery/mm4.png)

We're now logged in and we see that the MatterMost confirmation email has been added to the ticket information.

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-delivery/mm5.png)

To confirm the creation of our account we'll just copy/paste the included link into a browser new tab.

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-delivery/mm6.png)

After logging in to MatterMost we have access to the Internal channel where we see that credentials have been posted. There's also a hint that we'll have to use a variation of the `PleaseSubscribe!` password later.

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-delivery/mm7.png)

## User shell

With the `maildeliverer / Youve_G0t_Mail!` credentials we can SSH in and get the user flag.

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-delivery/user.png)

## Credentials in MySQL database

After doing some recon we find the MatterMost installation directory in `/opt/mattermost`:

```
maildeliverer@Delivery:/opt/mattermost/config$ ps waux | grep -i mattermost
matterm+   741  0.2  3.3 1649596 135112 ?      Ssl  20:00   0:07 /opt/mattermost/bin/mattermost
```

The `config.json` file contains the password for the MySQL database:

```
[...]
"SqlSettings": {
        "DriverName": "mysql",
        "DataSource": "mmuser:Crack_The_MM_Admin_PW@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/mattermost?charset=utf8mb4,utf8\u0026readTimeout=30s\u0026writeTimeout=30s",
[...]
```

We'll connect to the database server and poke around.

```
maildeliverer@Delivery:/$ mysql -u mmuser --password='Crack_The_MM_Admin_PW'

MatterMost user accounts are stored in the `Users` table and hashed with bcrypt. We'll save the hashes then try to crack them offline.

## Cracking with rules

There was a hint earlier that some variation of `PleaseSubscribe!` is used.

I'll use hashcat for this and since I don't know the hash ID for bcrypt by heart I can find it in the help.

```
C:\bin\hashcat>hashcat --help | findstr bcrypt
   3200 | bcrypt $2*$, Blowfish (Unix)                     | Operating System
```

My go-to rules is normally one of those two ruleset:

- [https://github.com/NSAKEY/nsa-rules/blob/master/_NSAKEY.v2.dive.rule](https://github.com/NSAKEY/nsa-rules/blob/master/_NSAKEY.v2.dive.rule)
- [https://github.com/NotSoSecure/password_cracking_rules/blob/master/OneRuleToRuleThemAll.rule](https://github.com/NotSoSecure/password_cracking_rules/blob/master/OneRuleToRuleThemAll.rule)

These will perform all sort of transformations on the wordlist and we can quickly crack the password: `PleaseSubscribe!21`

```
C:\bin\hashcat>hashcat -a 0 -m 3200 -w 3 -O -r rules\_NSAKEY.v2.dive.rule hash.txt wordlist.txt
[...]
$2a$10$VM6EeymRxJ29r8Wjkr8Dtev0O.1STWb4.4ScG.anuu7v0EFJwgjjO:PleaseSubscribe!21

Session..........: hashcat
Status...........: Cracked
Hash.Name........: bcrypt $2*$, Blowfish (Unix)
[...]
```

The root password from MatterMost is the same as the local root password so we can just su to root and get the system flag.
